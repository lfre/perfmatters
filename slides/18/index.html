* On the right side, you can see the waterfall for that same test of 2seconds. I have painted the resources to differentiate
* The resources at the top are first party, and there 11 of them
* The tag manager is the 7th request and it loads asynchronously, which then requests our Third Party
* with 125 requests. Besides the large amount of requests, these cannot be optimized or even prefetched because they change every time.
* So to answer the question “why is it still slow?"
* The answer was pretty clear

- Fixing this was going to take more than having executive buy in for how spend our time.
- There are multiple teams that don’t interact with us on a daily basis modifying this code, which is the goal of tag managers.
