- The reality is that the budget is blown by addition of small contributions where a bundle is increased by a few kbs here and there,
- and eventually 1 developer adding a couple of lines passes the budget, and then itâ€™s no ones responsibility.
- Depending on the amount or frequency by how Pull Requests are merged,
- a group of PRs could create a bad storm, which made me think if we could predict regressions.
