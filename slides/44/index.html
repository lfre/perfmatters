* This is a chance to share specific knowledge
* For example: If our action is to add something to our server side rendering becomes our goal is to improve the SEO impact of those pages, we can draw a path that includes looking at the markup size, and how that affects our Time to First Byte.
    * and prescribe some specific optimizations
    * Reducing DNS lookups
    * Using semantic HTML elements
    * Using regular URLs instead of hashes, if you have single page app use the History API to change content dynamically.
    * If you’re hitting multiple internal APIs, consider consolidating them behind a GraphQL endpoint.
    * This is like going to the doctor and telling them you’re planing to get sick in a month, so might as well give you the prescription for that date now.
