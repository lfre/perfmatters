* and so I asked what if performance is affecting your hypothesis, you have an idea and think users will react a certain way, and they might’ve but it was too slow.
* The answer I got was that it was accounted for during testing, they know it’s crappy they are just looking for a signal.
* If something that has bad performance still got some positive signals, means it can only get better, which makes sense.
* But there’s a problem with this, that features are not isolated.
* Other features being that an experiment or not, can be impacting the performance of your feature.
* But the thing is, we don’t need to tackle all the performance goals at this time.
