* Looking back
* Developers were challenges by constraints, which again is both good and bad.
Some devs enjoyed the challenge of doing more with less, but others saw it as slowing them down.
* which caused features taking longer to finish.
* Education without immediate action is quickly forgotten.
* Last year, I talked internally about performance non-stop,
* and a few weeks ago I noticed a conversation about React.lazy,
* where one of the developers asking if it was noticeable,
* and itâ€™s not like this person was oblivious to my presentations, but he thought codesplitting was a webpack thing.

* and you can look at each one of these things, and say you can hire devs with a focus on performance, you can show the business that moving slower but safer is an acceptable tradeoff, and you can invest more on education in and outside your organization.
