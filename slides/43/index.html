* Knowing the vision will let us document the tradeoffs of today, specifying if they were by design or because of a technical limitation.
* Open source packages would benefit greatly from this to prevent the same type of issue being created that is known to be outside of the creatorâ€™s intent or scope.
* This is usually done at the beginning when proposing a new architecture, but in reality it should occur with each feature, like merging a tradeoffs.md that gets automated like documentation pages. Documentation answers the why, but tradeoffs should answer the why not?
