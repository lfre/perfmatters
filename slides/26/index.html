* Looking back
* We focused on delivering results, which is both good and bad.
* I felt everyone was in the zone, but we forgot to check in with everyone else to make sure they understood our goals.
* and that’s why the teams felt it was a top-down decision
* and the question of how fast is fast enough kept coming up,
* from where we were it seemed like it was a drastic improvement
* but we were still pretty slow on older devices and slow 3G, so it was hard to know when to change strategies.
* Regardless of our next steps, we knew we couldn’t allow us to have regressions.
