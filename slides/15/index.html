* To put that into context, thatâ€™s 4 seconds on average to our First Contentful Paint
* This is where we were before
* and this is after
* Issues like not using font-display or using an icon font vs svg became more noticeable, but these were optimizations we knew we had to do, when we decided to tackle Javascript first.
* Still, it was weird to have that much blank space so we added a background color with a loader to change the loading perception.
* Even with these changes, we were still noticing some tests skyrocketing, and our Time To Interactive being really slow.
