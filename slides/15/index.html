* Before, we had a 360kb bundle that was used on all pages but also the homepage,
but the feed pages arenâ€™t as visible as the homepage.
* On a mobile device with 3G, it took almost 2 seconds to load, but then it blocked the main thread while executing which prevents other things from loading.
* This reflected into our load time of 13seconds
