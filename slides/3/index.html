* 1. Get the Executive Buy-In
* These are the people that decide how much time and effort the teams put into something
* First, we needed to know where we stand, so we measured
* Without any code changes, using webpagetest or lighthouse you can get metrics of how your site performs under different speeds.
* This is called synthetic testing, and with a small library like PerfurmeJS you can get the same metrics from real users, and store them in Google Analytics or a server of your own.
* Once you have that data, you can compare yourself to competitors using the HTTP Archive or with the UX Dashboard Rick will be talking about tomorrow.
