 - It analyzed the files modified in each open PR, and added a comment letting you know what other PRs were modifying the same files,
 - so that when a PR is merged, you don’t find that someone modified or removed a piece of code you were relying on,
 - and a piece of work that was deemed “done” is now back in development.

* This approach could be used to have a bot user that can generate a branch on demand and copying open PRs that are ready to merge every day,
* open a temporary PR and run performance tests.
* That way, we’d be able to predict that if an n amount of PRs were all to get merged and released today, that'd be our performance change.
* It’d allow us to be more proactive than reactive towards regressions and I’m happy to say that my plan is to open source these tools.
