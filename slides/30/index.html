* Is this worth it? 100ms?
* Building everything as fast as possible 100% of the time is not realistic, so we decided to ask ourselves some questions
* Is it part of the critical path? Meaning is this code being executed while the page is loading
* How frequent will it run? This applies to loops and interactive components like a date picker.
* Is it a shared or base component?
* and this is the most important question, because regardless of the objective time impact a piece of code has, the moment your code is merged it becomes the truth, and becomes someoneâ€™s pattern.
