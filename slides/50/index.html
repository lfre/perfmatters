* Webpack by default packages everything from node modules into 1 bundle, and it’s excessive,
* but the common approach is to package up your main framework.
* When moving from legacy code, it’s important to realize that your framework also has dependencies.
* Our legacy app uses Backbone which depends on jquery and underscore, but we noticed that some modules were using Backbone to be consistent without really using its features, but were using a lot more of jquery methods.
* That means that we were able to drop Backbone, underscore and more pretty easily which was 81kb, and only load jquery which by itself is bigger than all of them combined.
