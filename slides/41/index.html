* This is our usual process, someone has an idea, it’s pitched and a prototype is built, then tested, and if it meets the goals, it goes into full-fledge development to an MVP, and then we optimize.
* Our gut will tell us that this is where we think performance should happen, because everything before isn’t real yet so it seems futile.
* But, what if we try it at inception time?
* The immediate feedback I got after seeing how slow development got is that we’re simply moving the bottleneck to another place, and that it seems overkill.
