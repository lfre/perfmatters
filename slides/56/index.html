- This is on my wishlist.
- I wish web pack would allow options per entry or bundle.
- You can use the filter option, but this means the legacy files will not be covered and it becomes the wild west until they are refactored.
- You can argue that you can have multiple configurations, and that is true but that requires a bigger effort, and then we wonder why companies donâ€™t invest in their performance.
