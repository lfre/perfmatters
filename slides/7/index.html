* But there are a lot more...
* When I started at the company, we had considerably fewer properties so it made sense for them to be separate,
* but as we added more brands, it was challenging to maintain, deploy but also evolve.
* We were unable to experiment new features in smaller sites, and roll it out across the platform.
* So, we decided to build an application that would consolidate all of our sites.

* Thatâ€™s 100+ websites
* Powered by 1 application
* and, this is awesome because it gives us control, but at the same time we have the additional responsibility that when we break or reduce performance in a shared component, this is reflected immediately across the platform, and it hurts when that happens.
* Because of that, as we were writing our goals for 2018 we knew we had to put a special focus on performance.

I discovered this great conference, and convinced my boss to send me.
