* Applying these concepts allowed us to reduce our homepage bundle to 27kb. There were still some micro optimizations to do but we thought this was a great starting point.
* Using the same configuration, our bundle was now loading at 220ms, with the execution on the main thread more evenly and spread out.
* This reflected in our load time to as low as 2 and a half seconds.
